        <p>Here's my test task.</p>
        <p>According to requirements, app shows the list of announcements, and there's a possibility to view details, add new, edit or delete the announcement.</p>
        <p>On the details page we can see 3 similar announcements.</p>
        <p>App was implemented using ASP.NET Core MVC with the simple list as a mock database.</p>
        <p>It took me 3-4 hours during Thursday-Friday for back-end and about the same amount of time on the weekend for searching and implementing some simple UI.</p>
